The GenomeIndia Project, launched in January 2020 and funded by the Department of Biotechnology, represents a monumental stride in India's scientific landscape. This collaborative endeavor involves over 20 academic and research institutions nationwide, including the Centre for Brain Research at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. The project's primary objective is to construct a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variations that encapsulate the rich diversity of the Indian populace. In its initial phase, the project successfully collected over 19,000 blood samples, nearing its target of 20,000, and completed whole-genome sequencing for 10,074 samples spanning 99 ethnic groups. This extensive dataset is securely archived at the Indian Biological Data Centre (IBDC) in Faridabad, serving as a critical resource for future research endeavors. The GenomeIndia Project is poised to revolutionize public health by enabling the development of predictive diagnostic markers for various high-priority diseases, including cardiovascular conditions, mental illnesses, and cancers. By providing a detailed understanding of India's unique genetic makeup, the project lays the foundation for precision medicine tailored to the nation's diverse population. Moreover, this initiative addresses the underrepresentation of Indian genomes in global databases, thereby promoting inclusivity in genomic research. The publicly accessible genomic data empowers researchers worldwide to study genetic variations associated with diseases prevalent in the Indian context, fostering advancements in personalized medicine and targeted therapies. By establishing a robust biobank and facilitating open access to genomic data, the GenomeIndia Project not only propels India to the forefront of genomic research but also paves the way for a healthier future through genomics-based diagnostics and therapeutics. This is the unofficial codebase for India's first and most ambitious whole genome project. It contains codes used for understanding and interpreting the some of the data utilizing parallel processing, GPU support and much more.

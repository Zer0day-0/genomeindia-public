### Concordance analysis readme

Concordance analysis in genomic data is a method used to evaluate the agreement between two or more datasets, typically to assess the consistency 
of variant calls or genotypes across different platforms, pipelines, or replicates. It helps identify discrepancies, validate data quality, 
and ensure reproducibility. Commonly used metrics include overall genotype concordance, non-reference concordance, and variant overlap. 
Tools like PLINK, BCFtools, and RTG Tools are often employed to perform such analyses, making concordance analysis an essential step 
in quality control and benchmarking in genomics research.
